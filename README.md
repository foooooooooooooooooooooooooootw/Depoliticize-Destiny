## What?
<p>Removes virtue signaling from destiny related websites. At the current moment only https://trials.report is affected. </p>
  
<p>To use the install button above, read the "support" section below. </p>

 ## Why?
 <p>The most toxic gamemodes with the most toxic, cheater filled community should not concern or associate itself with political issues.</p>

 ## How?
 <p>I forced myself to learn javascript to hack together this extension. Being my first js project, I tried the best I could to optimize it. At the current moment the main content script is less than 60 LoC including comments and debug console logs (after many rewrites). Don't worry, I don't know enough about js right now to make a crypto miner in your web browser - not that I would. This extension does not block things from loading network-wise, it only removes it from your view.</p>

 ## When? 
 <p>For the foreseeable future I will be adding support for more websites if and when they show up, while continuing updates if there are changes. </p>

## Support
<p>The extension can be used with various chromium derivative browsers. For ungoogled chromium & opera, it's pretty straightforward with minimal configuration. You can click the button above and it should install fine. Ungoogled requires your "#extension-mime-request-handling" should be set to "Always prompt for install" under chrome://flags. For Opera, just click the pop-up, and then "install" for the extension. For edge & chrome, however, since the browser only accepts extensions from official stores, you will need to download & extract the zip, enable developer mode then "load unpacked" on the extracted folder.</p>

<p>Tested & working on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ungoogled Chromium 126</li>
  <li>Google Chrome 127</li>    
  <li>Microsoft Edge 127</li>
  <li>Opera 112</li>
</ul>
